Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there lived a man named Tristan who absolutely loved chicken cordon bleu. 
For Tristan, it wasn’t just food—it was a masterpiece, a symphony of flavors that brought him joy every time he took a bite.

Every Friday, Tristan treated himself to the best chicken cordon bleu in town at a small café called "Le Délice Bleu." 
He had a routine: he’d order his favorite dish, sit by the window, and savor each bite as he watched the world pass by.

One fateful Friday, as Tristan was halfway through his golden, cheesy delight, a man named Veliga barged into the café. 
Veliga was in a rush and, spotting Tristan’s plate of chicken cordon bleu, mistook it for his own order. 
Before Tristan could protest, Veliga had already grabbed the plate and dashed out the door.

Tristan sat there, stunned. His beloved chicken cordon bleu—gone! 
But instead of anger, Tristan felt curious. Who was this mysterious thief, and why did he look so familiar?

The next day, Tristan decided to return to "Le Délice Bleu," hoping to forget about the incident. 
To his surprise, Veliga was there, sitting at the very same table, looking guilty and holding a freshly made chicken cordon bleu. 
When Veliga noticed Tristan, he stood up and approached him.

“I’m so sorry about yesterday,” Veliga said sheepishly. 
“I was in a hurry, and I didn’t realize I’d taken your plate until I was halfway home. Let me make it up to you.”

Tristan, charmed by Veliga’s honesty, laughed and sat down. 
As they shared a meal together, they discovered they had more in common than just their love for chicken cordon bleu. 
Veliga was a chef who had recently moved to the city, and Tristan worked as a food critic.

Over the weeks, Tristan and Veliga’s meetings at "Le Délice Bleu" became a tradition. 
They shared stories, dreams, and, of course, countless servings of chicken cordon bleu.

One evening, as the sun set over the café, Veliga nervously slid a plate across the table to Tristan. 
On it, written in chocolate sauce, were the words: “Will you be my partner in life and in food?”

Tristan smiled, his heart as warm as the dish in front of him. 
“Yes,” he said. “But only if we keep sharing chicken cordon bleu.”

And so, their story became a tale of love, laughter, and the dish that brought them together. 
From then on, Tristan and Veliga were inseparable, proving that sometimes, the way to someone’s heart is truly through their stomach.
